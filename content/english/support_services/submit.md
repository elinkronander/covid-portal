To make your Covid-19 research data useful and accessible for the rest of the research community it should be published in a public repository together with descriptive metadata. When you deposit data in such a database, you can often set a moratorium, which means that data will not go public until a date that you set. By depositing data in a repository, you accept that the data will be published and may be used and redistributed according to specific terms, which you sometimes can set yourself, sometimes are set by the repository. Data deposition is considered important and you may get credit and acknowledgement for sharing data. A publication often results in getting a unique identifier for your dataset, which often is required for a journal to accept a manuscript for publication. Data sharing is often required by funders.

You can get support for data sharing and deposition in public databases by [SciLifeLab](mailto:datacentre@scilifelab.se) or [NBIS](mailto:support@nbis.se).

In Sweden, raw measurement data that is generated in a project belongs to the university, while the results are owned by the researcher - the so colled teacher's exception. Unless the data needs protection because of contractual obligations or personal privacy, for example in sensitive personal data such as biomedical measurements on humans, data is considered a public act. The university has a responsibility to archive the data. Data publishing as supported here is important for the research process, but does not replace the legal responsibility of the university. As a researcher, you are recommended to ensure long term storage of your data in facilities provided by your university. While a project is active, compute and storage services can be provided by [SNIC](https://snic.se).

For most biological datatypes, there are international databases that can be considered de facto standards. For data types where no suitable international repository is available, your data can be deposited to a [General data repository](../general_data_repository).

[SciLifeLab](https://www.scilifelab.se) and [NBIS](http://www.nbis.se/) can support you with Data Management Planning early on in the projects to make data sharing more efficient, both through [personal consultations](https://nbis.se/support/supportform/index.php?form=consultation) and by providing a [customised tool](https://dsw.scilifelab.se/) to create Data Management Plans.
We can also assist you in identifying relevant repositories and common international standards for describing and publishing your data, as well as guide you through the submission process.

_Note that data from human individuals might need special considerations when it comes to publishing._
